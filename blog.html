        <h2>First Impressions of Vanilla JavaScript vs React</h2>

            <p> Vanilla JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages, and with its popularity came front-end frameworks and libraries such as React JS. React, from my small experience, changes the approach taken when coding in as compared with Vanilla.  </p>

        <h4>A Comparison</h4>
            
            <p>  One of the first instances is the manipulation of the DOM. Vanilla JS manipulates it directly, whereas React creates a virtual DOM. Manipulating the DOM directly can become cumbersome the more complex the website. With React creating a virtual DOM, it allows for more effective updates and improved performance. </p>
            
            <p>React works as a single page application, using components that can change to make up the UI of a website. Components in react are simply pieces of UI that have their own appearance and logic. This is more effective as the components can be reused seamlessly, as well as allow for more ease when updating components across a website. Because of these reasons, React gives a developer a much better experience when it comes to the management of UI components. Vanilla JavaScript requires a manual approach to handling UI, which means less structure and much more dense code to handle and to work with across many pages.  </p>
            
            <p> The syntax of Vanilla JS and React also differ. Vanilla JS is much looser and forgiving in its syntax, which can help ease the learning curve for beginners, but also encourages sloppy code. HTML and CSS are also typically coded on different file pages with JavaScript. The benefit or deterrent of this is based on preference, but it does make for a more separate workflow, having to switch between working files.  </p>
                
            <p> The syntax of React is stricter, which can be frustrating for beginners, however, it will force them to write code well. React’s syntax essentially brings JavaScript into HTML, and allows embedding JavaScript expressions, using HTML-like tags, attributes, and supports self-closing tags. It is later transformed into JavaScript code for execution in the browser. </p>
            
        <h4>Experience Creating To-Do Apps </h4>

            <p>  I used both Vanilla JavaScript and React to create to-do apps (though it was more of a follow along). Because I’m inexperienced with both and this was my first impression of either, I did find Vanilla JavaScript to be more understandable initially, but this was more of the understanding of the language itself, not necessarily the use of it. As I began to understand React better, understanding how it is built on the implementation of separate components, I find that I prefer using React over Vanilla.  </p>

           <p> Having HTML and JavaScript on the same document just felt more cohesive to work with. I didn’t need to consistently switch back and forth between the two to see what a class or ID name was. The use of components has quickly become something I deeply appreciate. I find the organizational aspect of using them makes my code feel much less overwhelming. Having the ability to edit the component independently and have that update across all the places I used the component in the code is a much nicer experience, as with Vanilla, I would have to sift through my code tediously making the adjustments to each one.  </p>

            <p>While I continue my journey of learning web development, I hope to build a greater understanding and efficiency in working with both Vanilla JavaScript and React. While I prefer the use of React, I believe also working with Vanilla JavaScript will give me a stronger base of knowledge to work off of, so I can then move more deeply into frameworks like React to create cool shi- stuff. </p>
