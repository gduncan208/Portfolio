        <h2>Step Up your Mockup Game: Embrace Blender for Custom 3D Mockups</h2>
            <p>Mockups are a fantastic tool in showcasing design work, though they come with some complications. Good templates usually come at a price, and customizing those templates beyond placing a design on them is rather limited. So, what can be done? </p>

            <p>If you're up to a bit of a learning curve, making use of a 3D modelling software, like Blender, to create your own custom mockups allows for many possibilities. So, let’s take a scroll and explain what Blender is and the benefits of using 3D modeling for your mockups. </p>

            <img src="blog-assets/hotshellcardsbetter - Copy.png" alt="Mockup of business cards" class="b-img-300"/>


            <h4>What the donk is Blender? And why do I recommend it? </h4>

            <p>Blender is an open-source 3D software that is... wait for it... completely FREE. And it being free has nothing to do with a lack of quality, this software is incredibly capable and versatile. Blender does have a bit of a daunting learning curve; however, it has a large active community that outputs plenty of great resources for learning. Something important to note: your computer must be capable of using Blender. </p>

            <p>
            Blender recommends at least 8GB of ram, and a decent GPU, among other things. Blender has a page <a href="https://www.blender.org/download/requirements/" target="_blank">here</a> that goes further in depth on the matter.  </p>

            <p>If you have the computer for it, and because of the accessibility of Blender, I stand by it as my recommendation for creating your first 3D mockup. You can install Blender <a href="https://www.blender.org/download/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

            <h4>What so special about creating 3D Mockups?</h4>

            <p>The task of creating a 3D model for a mockup may sound like more work than it’s worth, so why do it? While yes, creating a 3D mockup will require some more effort, it also gives you many more possibilities in what you can achieve. </p>

            <h5>Customization</h5>

            <p>Being the creator of your mockup allows you to further manipulate more aspects of the mockup. Camera angle, scene setup, colors, lighting, all of these are for you to control. 
            </p>
 

            <h5>Animation </h5>
            
            <p>We are working with animation software, why not take it a step further and make an animated presentation of your mockup!</p>

            <h5>Reusability  </h5>

            <p>Depending on the dimensions needed for your design and model, the mockups you create can be reused to your heart’s desire. </p>

            <h4>Getting Started</h4>

            <p>While I won’t go into depth on how to make a mockup in this article, I will recommend a place to start. </p>

            <p>Find a beginner tutorial on YouTube. I recommend the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0J27sf9N1Y&list=PLjEaoINr3zgEPv5y--4MKpciLaoQYZB1Z&ab_channel=BlenderGuru" target="_blank">donut tutorial by Blender Guru</a>. While it’s a longer, multistep tutorial, it touches on a bit of everything. By the end of it you’ll be comfortable moving around Blender and have a basic familiarity with most of the tools and interface.   </p>

            <p>Blender is an excellent resource to add to your toolkit as a designer.  With just a little consistency and determination, you can create free, customizable, and versatile mockups for your designs.  </p>

        <h2>First Impressions of Vanilla JavaScript vs React</h2>

            <p> Vanilla JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages, and with its popularity came front-end frameworks and libraries such as React JS. React, from my small experience, changes the approach taken when coding in as compared with Vanilla.  </p>

        <h4>A Comparison</h4>
            
            <p>  One of the first instances is the manipulation of the DOM. Vanilla JS manipulates it directly, whereas React creates a virtual DOM. Manipulating the DOM directly can become cumbersome the more complex the website. With React creating a virtual DOM, it allows for more effective updates and improved performance. </p>
            
            <p>React works as a single page application, using components that can change to make up the UI of a website. Components in react are simply pieces of UI that have their own appearance and logic. This is more effective as the components can be reused seamlessly, as well as allow for more ease when updating components across a website. Because of these reasons, React gives a developer a much better experience when it comes to the management of UI components. Vanilla JavaScript requires a manual approach to handling UI, which means less structure and much more dense code to handle and to work with across many pages.  </p>
            
            <p> The syntax of Vanilla JS and React also differ. Vanilla JS is much looser and forgiving in its syntax, which can help ease the learning curve for beginners, but also encourages sloppy code. HTML and CSS are also typically coded on different file pages with JavaScript. The benefit or deterrent of this is based on preference, but it does make for a more separate workflow, having to switch between working files.  </p>
                
            <p> The syntax of React is stricter, which can be frustrating for beginners, however, it will force them to write code well. React’s syntax essentially brings JavaScript into HTML, and allows embedding JavaScript expressions, using HTML-like tags, attributes, and supports self-closing tags. It is later transformed into JavaScript code for execution in the browser. </p>
            
        <h4>Experience Creating To-Do Apps </h4>

        <a href="https://github.com/gduncan208/vanilla-js-todo" target="_blank">Vanilla</a>
        <br>
        <a href="https://github.com/gduncan208/todo-react" target="_blank">React</a>
        

            <p>  I used both Vanilla JavaScript and React to create to-do apps (though it was more of a follow along). Because I’m inexperienced with both and this was my first impression of either, I did find Vanilla JavaScript to be more understandable initially, but this was more of the understanding of the language itself, not necessarily the use of it. As I began to understand React better, understanding how it is built on the implementation of separate components, I find that I prefer using React over Vanilla.  </p>

           <p> Having HTML and JavaScript on the same document just felt more cohesive to work with. I didn’t need to consistently switch back and forth between the two to see what a class or ID name was. The use of components has quickly become something I deeply appreciate. I find the organizational aspect of using them makes my code feel much less overwhelming. Having the ability to edit the component independently and have that update across all the places I used the component in the code is a much nicer experience, as with Vanilla, I would have to sift through my code tediously making the adjustments to each one.  </p>

            <p>While I continue my journey of learning web development, I hope to build a greater understanding and efficiency in working with both Vanilla JavaScript and React. While I prefer the use of React, I believe also working with Vanilla JavaScript will give me a stronger base of knowledge to work off of, so I can then move more deeply into frameworks like React to create cool shi- stuff. </p>
